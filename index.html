            Our platform uses a dynamic password system which changes each time
            it is used, this key is sent by email when requested, for this
            reason, there is no fixed password or option to change the password
            or recover it.

            On your profile page you can request the deletion of your account,
            this process can take up to 8 days to complete.

          <p>
            No need to worry, your account is safe. If you didn't request the
            access code, don't worry, you may simply omit the email and that
            would be it. This can happen because someone entered a wrong email
            or tried to access your account, but as long as you do not share the
            code that you received, your account is safe.

            No, if the deletion process has already been executed, you will no

          <p>
            When you publish code to skriper.dev it is then 
            licensed under the MIT license. If your code is private we
             do not give it any license and you can license it as you may please,
              we recommend that you include the type of license as a comment in your code.
               Remember that when publishing a code in creeper.dev publicly other users can 
               “fork” your code, skriper.dev keeps as a reference the original code from where
                the fork was made as an attribution of the respective credits.

        <div class="content">
          <p>Copying a code is performing a "copy & paste" and not a fork,
             the fork maintains the respective relationship with the code 
             from which it was copied, but if you consider that the code
              was copied, you can send us a review request to our email.
               If you want to disable the fork option in your code, just go to 
            settings in the editor and disable the fork option.</p>
